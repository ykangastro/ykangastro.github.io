I am a postdoctoral researcher and an Observing Specialist at Rubin Observatory in Chile. 

As an Observing Specialist, the main role is to support commissioning and operational activities including controlling and operating telescopes and cameras together with subsystems, troubleshooting, reporting night test/observing logs and fault reports. Before joining Rubin/SLAC, I had worked at Gemini for three years. As a Gemini Science Fellow, I dedicated a half of my total time for observatory support including Queue coordinating, night observations, instrument support, and telescope user support.

As a postdoctoral researcher, I have been working on Type Ia Supernovae Science, specifically SN Ia host galaxies. I am also interested in stellar populations and evolution of galaxies in general.  

If you want to contact me, please feel free to reach out through ykang (at) slac.stanford.edu.
